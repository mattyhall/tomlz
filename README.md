# tomlz
A TOML parser for Zig targeting TOML v1.0.0, an easy API and safety.

```zig
var gpa = std.heap.page_allocator;
var table = try parser.parse(gpa,
    \\foo = 1
    \\bar = 2

);
defer table.deinit(gpa);

table.getInteger("foo").?; // 1
```

Main tracks zig master, but we also have a 
[0.10.0](https://github.com/mattyhall/tomlz/tree/zig-0.10.0) branch.

## Current status
All types other than datetimes are supported. We pass 321/334 of the
[toml tests](https://github.com/BurntSushi/toml-test) 11 of those are due to not
having datetime support and the other two are minor lexing issues (allowing
whitespace between the square brackets of an array header).

The API is quite barebones at the moment but
[decoding to structs](https://github.com/mattyhall/tomlz/issues/7) is on our
radar.

## Installation
tomlz supports being a vendored dependency, zigmod and gyro.

### zigmod
To use in a project where your dependencies are handled by
[zigmod](https://github.com/nektro/zigmod) you can simply run:

```
$ zigmod aq add 1/mattyhall/tomlz
$ zigmod fetch
```

and import using

```zig
const tomlz = @import("tomlz");
```

An [example is available](https://github.com/mattyhall/tomlz/tree/main/examples/zigmod).

### gyro
To use in a project where your dependencies are handled by
[gyro](https://github.com/mattnite/gyro) you can simply run:

```
$ gyro add mattyhall/tomlz
$ gyro fetch
```

An [example is available](https://github.com/mattyhall/tomlz/tree/main/examples/gyro).

### Submodule
To add as a package a common approach is to clone this repository as a submodule
in your own, and then add it as a package in `build.zig` like so:

```zig
    const exe = b.addExecutable("simple", "src/main.zig");
    exe.setTarget(target);
    exe.setBuildMode(mode);
    exe.addPackagePath("tomlz", "third_party/tomlz/src/main.zig");
    exe.install();
```

## Usage
We currently provide a single entry point for parsing which returns a toml
`Table` type. This type has helper methods for getting values out:

```zig
var gpa = std.heap.page_allocator;
var table = try parser.parse(gpa,
    \\int = 1
    \\float = 2.0
    \\boolean = true
    \\string = "hello, world"
    \\array = [1, 2, 3]
    \\table = { subvalue = 1, we.can.nest.keys = 2 }
);
defer table.deinit(gpa);

table.getInteger("int");
table.getFloat("float");
table.getBool("boolean");
table.getString("string");
table.getArray("array");
table.getTable("table");
```

A simple example is
[provided](https://github.com/mattyhall/tomlz/tree/main/examples/simple/).

## Goals and non-goals
Goals and non-goals are subject to change based on how the project is used and
my own time constraints. If you feel a goal or non-goal isn't quite right please
open an issue and we can discuss it.

### Goals
- TOML v1.0.0. The datetime portion of this is probably going to be
  unachievable until Zig gets a good standard library type for it or a library
  gets dominance. Other than that however we should pass all the
  [tests](https://github.com/BurntSushi/toml-test)
- A nice API. Getting values from the `Value` type should be painless as
  possible and we should also provide deserialising a `Table` into a struct,
  similarly to how `std.json` does it
- Easy installation. We should try to make using the library as a vendored
  dependency and as a package - on e.g. [gyro](https://github.com/mattnite/gyro)
  \- as easy as possible
- Safety. The parser should never crash no matter the input. To achieve this we
  should run fuzzing against it
- Support Zig master and the latest tagged release until Zig v1.0. This will be
  done by having the main branch track Zig master and a branch for each Zig
  release. Any improvements should be backported to the most recent release
  branch
- Good error messages

### Non-goals
- Super duper performance. We want to be as performant as possible without
  making the code harder to read. It is unlikely that parsing a TOML file is
  going to be the bottleneck in your application so "good" performance should be
  sufficient
- Previous versions of TOML
